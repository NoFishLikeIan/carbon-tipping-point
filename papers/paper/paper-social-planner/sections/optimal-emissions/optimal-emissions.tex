Figure (\ref{fig:optimal:emissions}) and (\ref{fig:optimal:carbon concentration}) display the optimal path of net emissions $E$ and carbon concentration $M$ respectively in three scenario: an albedo loss $\Delta\lambda = 6\%$, in which there is no tipping point; a loss of $\Delta\lambda = 8\%$ in which there is a tipping point; the benchmark stochastic model. The optimal emissions fall rapidly in all three parametrisation, highlighting the importance of rapid abatement. Yet, optimal emission path in the benchmark Stochastic Tipping model resembles closely that of $6\%$ the albedo loss. On the contrary, in the presence of a tipping point, that is, the $8\%$ albedo loss, emissions fall more rapidly and abatement policies are more ambitious. This leads to much lower optimal long run carbon concentration, if there is a tipping point induced by the albedo effect. Using the Stochastic Tipping model as an approximation of a tipping point can lead to insufficiently ambitious abatement policies, both in scope and in timing.

Figure \ref{fig:optimal:gdp}, shows the resulting optimal median path of GDP (solid line) and consumption (dashed line). GDP follows similar trajectories under all three specifications of climate dynamics, which suggests that the additional abatement expenditure in the case of $8\%$ albedo loss, is fully compensated by reduced temperature damages. Yet, the amount of GDP consumed in the latter specification is lower than in the cases of $6\%$ albedo loss and stochastic tipping, as more GDP is devoted to abatement.
