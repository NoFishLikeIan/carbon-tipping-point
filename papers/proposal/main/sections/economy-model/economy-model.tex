We consider a social planner that seeks to maximise the functional \begin{equation}
    J(e; x_0, c_0) = \mathbb{E}_{x} \int^{\infty}_0 e^{-\rho t} \Big(u(e) - d(x)\Big) \text{d} t,
\end{equation}

subject to the dynamics $\text{d}x$ and $\text{d}c$, with respect to an emission path $e$, which we assume to be a continuously differentiable function of time taking values in an interval $\mathcal{E} = [e_l, e_u]$. We will consider both the case in which carbon capture technology is, $e_l < 0$, or is not, $e_l = 0$, available to the planner. Furthermore, we assume benefits of emission to be concave, $u^{\prime \prime} < 0$, and temperature damages to be convex, $d^{\prime \prime} > 0$.

We approach the problem by deriving a small-noise approximation of the value function, as in \citein{grass_small-noise_2015}. Namely, rewriting the temperature process as \begin{equation}
    \text{d} x = \Big(\mu(x) + C_0 + C_1 \log(c / c_p)\Big) \text{d} t + \sqrt{2\varepsilon \sigma^2} \text{d}w,
\end{equation}

we seek to compute the value function \begin{equation}
    v(x, c, \varepsilon) = \sup_{e} J(e; x, c).
\end{equation}

For each temperature and carbon concentration pair, $(x, c) \in \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{C}$, and vector of shadow prices $(p_x, p_c) \in \mathbb{R}^2$, let the maximised current value Hamiltonian be \begin{equation}
    \mathcal{H}(x, c, p_x, p_c) = \max_e \Big\{u(e) + p_c e \Big\} - p_c \ \delta c - d(x) + p_x \Big(\mu(x) + C_0 + C_1 \log(c / c_p)\Big),
\end{equation} then the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman states that for all $\varepsilon > 0$ there exist an optimal emission schedule $e = \varphi(x, c, \varepsilon)$, such that the value function satisfies the following partial differential equation \begin{equation} \label{eq:hbj}
    \rho \ v = \varepsilon \sigma^2 \ \partial_{x x} v + \mathcal{H}(x, c, \partial_x v, \partial_c v).
\end{equation}

We assume that there exist an asymptotic expansion \begin{equation}
    v(x, c, \varepsilon) = v_0(x, c) + \varepsilon v_1(x, c) + \varepsilon^2 v_2(x, c) + \ldots
\end{equation} with $v_j$ twice continuously differentiable functions.
\subsection{Deterministic problem}

We will first study the dynamics in absence of noise, that is with $\varepsilon = 0$, such that the value function reduces to $v(x, c, 0) = v_0(x, c)$. Then the Hamilton-Bellman-Jacobi equation (\ref{eq:hbj}) reduces to \begin{equation}
    \rho \ v_0(x, c) = \mathcal{H}(x, c, \partial_x v_0, \partial_c v_0).
\end{equation}

\subsection{An Illustrative Example}

Consider the simple case $u(e) = \beta_0 e - \frac{1}{2} \beta_1 e^2$ and $d(x) = \frac{1}{2}\gamma (x - x_p)^2$ where $x_p$ is the pre-industrial temperature level.
